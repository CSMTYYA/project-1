                         <p class="words"> This project started as something small — just a way to earn a certificate for my LinkedIn.
At first, I didn’t expect much from it. But as I began coding, something clicked.
I realized I wasn’t just completing a requirement — I was building my first real project.<br><br> Every line of code taught me something new — how to debug, how to structure, how to create.
What started as a task slowly became a passion.
This project became the start of my journey as a developer —
a reminder that sometimes, the smallest beginnings lead to the biggest changes.</p>

                            <p class="words"> This project began when I started a GitHub course at Cairo University.
At first, my goal was simple — I just wanted to understand how GitHub works: repositories, commits, branches, and all the basics of version control.
But as I explored more, I realized it was more than just a tool — it was a whole new way of thinking about collaboration and coding.
Through this project, I learned how developers share ideas, track progress, and build together. <br><br>
It marked the beginning of my journey into the real world of software development. First, There was just a normal course with attending some sessions and learning alone in home but i didn't understand fully about it. Secondly, There was also quizes in college so i needed to study and learn what we took. Finally, The thing that i didn't want it to happen <strong>THE COURSE'S GRADUATION PROJECT.</strong>   </p>

TBH, my cousin helped me alot in this project he teached me the basics of github and HTML & CSS and let me do this project the <strong class="topic-name">Dev-Portofolio</strong>
